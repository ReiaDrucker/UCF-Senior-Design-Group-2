** The Build System in Detail
   - The requirements are specified in [[../depth2/pyproject.toml][pyproject.toml.]]
    
   - The entrypoint for the build system is in [[../depth2/setup.py][setup.py]].
   It uses [[https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][scikit-build]] and [[https://cmake.org][cmake]] to build the project.
    
   - [[../depth2/CMakeLists.txt][CMakeLists.txt]] handles the rest of the build.
     - [[https://conan.io][conan]] is used to handle installing the C++ dependencies.
